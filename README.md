# Traffic-Signal-Recognition
I created a neural network to recognize traffic signals from the german traffic signal database. Using TensorFlow and Keras neural network was optimized to 99%. Created a Convolutional Neural Network which performed flattening and pooling to simplify the image. Output was based on softmax activation function.
